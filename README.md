# EmployeeMenu
Using the EmployeeDatabase.csv build a program that meets the following requirements. The program will be a command line menu-based application and all prompts to the users should be clear and concise.  
The menu and layout can be decided upon by yourself as the programmer, however it should make logical sense and have a clear flow.  
Below is the functionality we require you to create and have a functional menu option for are as follows; 
	• View all employees by name 
	• View an individual employee’s full details  
	• Display the company’s total salary cost for the organisation 
	• Display a breakdown of the total salaries per department* 
	• Add a new employee to the list prompting the user to select which department* they belong to and then to input their name, age, salary and years of service 
	• Identify the highest earning employee 
	• Identify the lowest earning employee 
	• Identify the longest serving employee based on years of service 
	• Identify the newest employee based on years of service
